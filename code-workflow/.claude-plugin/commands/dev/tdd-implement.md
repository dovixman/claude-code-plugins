# Task:
I'll help you implement the feature using Test-Driven Development (TDD). We'll follow these steps:

First, I'll analyze the requirements for $ARGUMENTS
I'll create comprehensive tests that define the expected behavior
I'll verify the tests fail (red)
I'll implement the minimum code needed to pass the tests (green)
I'll refactor the code while keeping tests passing (refactor)
Let's start by understanding what we're building and creating a test plan. What specifically should $ARGUMENTS do, and what edge cases should we consider?

Remember our TDD principles:

Tests must be written before implementation code
Tests must fail initially to prove they're testing something real
Implementation should be the minimum necessary to pass tests
Refactoring should maintain passing tests
Files should not exceed 300 lines
Follow the Three-Stage Component Testing approach:
Storybook isolation
Test harness integration
System integration
I'll help you through each phase of this TDD process for $ARGUMENTS.
