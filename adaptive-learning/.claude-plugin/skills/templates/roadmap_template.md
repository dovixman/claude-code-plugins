# 📖 How to Use the Feynman Technique with Claude Code

**IMPORTANT: Language Adaptation** - All guidance below uses English examples, but when applying these techniques, respond in the language you are learning in.

The Feynman Technique is your compass for validating real understanding. Here's how to use it integrated into your learning process:

## Stage 1: Learning (Content Consumption)
- Read books, documentation, tutorials from the recommended resources
- Take notes: What did I understand? What didn't I?
- **Prompt for Claude Code (adapt to your language):**
  ```
  I have these doubts about [Concept]:
  - [Doubt 1]
  - [Doubt 2]
  Explain it to me in the context of [your specific area].
  ```

## Stage 2: Teaching (Understanding Validation)
- Explain the concept as if you were teaching someone completely new
- **Prompt for Claude Code (adapt to your language):**
  ```
  Explain in simple terms how [Concept] would work in the context of [your specific application].
  Don't use jargon. Pretend my audience is [profile of your audience].
  ```
- If you can't explain something without confusion, that's a gap

## Stage 3: Gap Identification
- Note exactly where your explanation breaks down
- Study those specific parts again
- **Prompt for Claude Code (adapt to your language):**
  ```
  I don't completely understand [specific part]. Explain it to me another way.
  Use analogies with [concept you already know well].
  ```

## Stage 4: Simplification
- Reduce each concept to its essence in a maximum of 3 paragraphs
- It should be understandable to someone in your field without deep prior knowledge

## Stage 5: Practical Application
- Implement what you learned in the practical projects in the roadmap
- **Suggested command (if you use Claude Code):**
  ```
  /impl:tdd-implement [description of practical project]
  ```
- This forces you to really apply the knowledge

## Stage 6: Teaching Others (Mastery)
- Create documentation or guides that others can follow
- Answer questions about the topic in your professional/academic context
- Share your knowledge

# 💡 Final Tips for Your Success

1. **Avoid Tutorial Hell:** Don't consume content indefinitely. BUILD after learning basic concepts.

2. **Use Feynman Religiously:** If you can't explain something in simple terms, you don't completely understand it.

3. **Keep Code/Projects Simple:** Complexity emerges naturally. Start with the simplest possible approach.

4. **Iterate Fast:** Better to have something functional and basic than a perfect design that doesn't exist.

5. **[Specific tip about the topic 1]**

6. **[Specific tip about your field]**

7. **Contribute:** Once you gain confidence, contribute to open-source projects or share your knowledge.

8. **Stay Updated:** [How to stay updated in this specific topic]
