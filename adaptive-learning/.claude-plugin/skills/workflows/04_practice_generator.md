# Workflow 4: Practice Generator

## Purpose

Generate personalized and hands-on practical activities to apply knowledge from a specific subtopic of a roadmap. Activities can be coding projects, theoretical exercises, case studies, or a mix, depending on the topic and user context.

**IMPORTANT: Language Adaptation**
All questions, activities, and responses generated by this workflow must be in the same language the user writes in. If the user writes in Spanish, generate activities in Spanish. If they write in English, generate in English. If they use another language, match that language.

## When to Activate

This workflow activates when:
- User asks for "practice", "exercise", "activity", "project to apply"
- Phrases like: "generate a practical activity about [topic]", "what can I do to practice"
- User has a roadmap and wants a specific activity for a subtopic

## Prerequisites

- An existing roadmap (generated by Workflow 1 or any learning plan file)
- Path to the roadmap file
- Identification of the specific subtopic/concept to generate practice for

## Output

- Personalized practical activity in markdown format
- Includes: objective, context, detailed steps, success criteria, resources
- Format: markdown file `<subtopic>_practice_activity.md` or displayed in terminal

## PHASE 1: Identify Roadmap and Subtopic

### Step 1.1: Request Roadmap Path

If user has NOT provided the roadmap path:

**Question:** (in user's language)
"To generate a personalized practical activity, I need the path to your learning roadmap. Where is it located?"

**Expected response examples:**
- `~/learning/AI_Agents_learning_plan.md`
- `~/projects/Kubernetes_learning_plan.md`
- `./React_Frontend_learning_plan.md`

### Step 1.2: Read the Roadmap

Once you have the path:

```
Use: file_read to read the complete roadmap content
```

**If the file doesn't exist or can't be read:**
- Inform user clearly
- Ask for an alternative path or verify the file exists
- Offer alternative: "Would you like to generate an activity without a roadmap? (less personalized)"

### Step 1.3: Identify the Subtopic

If user has NOT specified which subtopic/concept to practice:

**Option A (if `AskUserQuestion` is available):**
- Extract all concepts/subtopics from the roadmap
- Present them as Single-select options
- Question: (in user's language) "For which of these concepts would you like to generate a practical activity?"

**Option B (if `AskUserQuestion` is NOT available):**
- List the main concepts from the roadmap
- Ask: (in user's language) "Which of these concepts would you like to practice?"

**Example:**

```
I've read your AI Agents roadmap. I see these concepts:

Level 1 (Beginner):
1. LLMs 101
2. Tokenization and Embeddings
3. Your first simple Agent
4. Basic API Integration

Level 2 (Intermediate):
5. Advanced Prompting and Chains
6. RAG - Retrieval + Generation
7. Multi-Agent Architectures
8. Memory & Context Management

Level 3 (Advanced):
9. Fine-tuning & LoRA
10. Enterprise Agent Design

For which of these concepts would you like to generate a practical activity?
```

## PHASE 2: Analyze Subtopic Context

Once the subtopic is identified, extract from the roadmap:

### 2.1: Roadmap Information

**Extract:**

1. **Concept description** in the roadmap
2. **Level** (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
3. **Suggested practical project** (if exists in roadmap)
4. **Prerequisites** (previous concepts needed)
5. **User context:**
   - Application scope (from roadmap profile)
   - Context (work, personal, academic)
   - Final objective (from roadmap)
   - Technological constraints (if exist)
   - Learning style (practical, theoretical, mixed)

### 2.2: Determine Activity Complexity

Based on the concept's level:

**Level 1 (Beginner):**
- Simple, step-by-step activity
- Estimated time: 1-3 hours
- Focus on applying basics
- No complex dependencies

**Level 2 (Intermediate):**
- More complex activity
- Estimated time: 3-8 hours or 1-2 days
- Focus on applying multiple concepts
- May require tool integration

**Level 3 (Advanced):**
- Integrating project
- Estimated time: several days or weeks
- Focus on solving real problem
- Integrates multiple roadmap concepts

---

## PHASE 3: Determine Activity Type

Based on:
- **Nature of the concept** (technical, theoretical, architectural)

## Quality Guidelines

### Characteristics of Effective Activities

✅ **Good activities:**
- **Clear and measurable objectives:** "At the end, you'll have a functional RAG system that answers questions about your own documents"
- **Specific and actionable steps:** "Step 1: Install ChromaDB. Step 2: Load documents in 500-token chunks"
- **Contextualized to user:** If the roadmap mentions Python, use Python; if it mentions finance, use financial examples
- **Appropriate level:** Neither too easy nor too difficult for the concept level
- **Verifiable success criteria:** Concrete checklist of what must work

❌ **Bad activities:**
- **Vague objectives:** "Learn about RAG" (how is that measured?)
- **Generic steps:** "Implement RAG" (no guidance)
- **Decontextualized:** Activity about medicine when user works in fintech
- **Incorrect level:** PhD-level activity for a Level 1 concept
- **No clear criteria:** "Do it well" (what is "well"?)

### Context Adaptation

**Always consider from the roadmap:**
- **Application context** (work, personal, academic)
- **Specific domain** (NLP, Computer Vision, Backend, etc.)
- **Technological constraints** (open-source only, Python 3.8+, etc.)
- **Final objective** (get a job, complete a project, etc.)
- **Learning style** (practical, theoretical, mixed)

---

## Example Generation

### Example: Generate Activity for "RAG" (Intermediate Level)

**Roadmap context:**
- User: AI Engineer
- Domain: AI Agents
- Context: Work/Professional
- Style: Mixed
- Constraints: Python, open-source preferred

**Generated activity:**

```markdown
# 🎯 Practical Activity: RAG - Retrieval + Generation

**Concept:** RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
**Level:** Intermediate
**Type:** Mix (Design + Implementation)
**Estimated time:** 6-8 hours
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐☆☆

## 📝 Context

In your AI Agents roadmap, RAG is a critical component that enables
agents to answer questions about information that wasn't in their training
data. Instead of fine-tuning a model (expensive and slow), RAG searches for
relevant information and provides it to the LLM as context.

This activity will take you from conceptual design to a functional
implementation of a basic RAG system.

## 🎯 Objective

By completing this activity, you will be able to:

1. Design the architecture of a RAG system for a specific use case
2. Implement a local vector store with ChromaDB
3. Build a document ingestion pipeline with chunking
4. Implement retrieval based on semantic similarity
5. Integrate the system with an LLM (OpenAI/Anthropic)

**Expected result:**
Functional system that answers questions about your own technical documentation
using RAG.

## Error Handling

### If roadmap doesn't exist
- Offer to generate activity without roadmap (less personalized)
- Suggest creating roadmap first (Workflow 1)

### If subtopic isn't clearly in the roadmap
- Ask user if they want an activity anyway
- Offer closest subtopic from roadmap
- Generate generic activity if user confirms

### If concept is too advanced
- Warn user about the level
- Suggest completing prerequisites first
- Offer simplified version of the activity

### If file cannot be saved
- Show in terminal as alternative
- Ask for alternative location
- Offer to copy content manually

---

## Success Criteria

This workflow works correctly when:

- ✅ Activity is personalized to user's context (from roadmap)
- ✅ Difficulty level is appropriate for the concept
- ✅ Steps are clear, specific, and actionable
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable and verifiable
- ✅ Activity is completable in the estimated time
- ✅ Activity type (code/theoretical/case/mix) is appropriate
- ✅ User can start working immediately
